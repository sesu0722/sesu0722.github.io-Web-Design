# Web Visualization Dashboard 

## Background

Use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the analysis and visualization for attitude dependence of the global weather.


## Introduction

For this project, I create a website by using visualizations that were created by the weather data (Resources/cities.csv) provided.

There are individual pages for each plot and a side bar to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and analysis. A landing page (index.html) to explanation of the project and links to each visualizations page, along with another page to present the data used to build them.

### Website

The website consists of seven pages in total, including:

* A landing page (index.html) containing the following elements:

  * An explanation of the project

  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image will take the user to that visualization.

* Four visualization pages (temperature.html, humidity.html, cloudiness.html and windspeed.html) each with the following elements:

  * A descriptive title and heading tag.

  * The plot or visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs: max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, or wind speed). The images displayed on these pages is stored in the `assets/images` folder.

  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

* A Comparisons page (comparison.html) that Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can easily be compared with each other.

* A Data page (data.html) that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
